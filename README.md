This is a pure clone of the original [hunpos source code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hunpos/source/default/source).
I cloned it to make sure I still have access to it in future, even if Google might discontinue their repository archive status.

License of the project is [New BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

I do not maintain this project at all. To my current knowledge, it seems discontinued, because
there does not seem to be a newer repository for hunpos anywhere.
